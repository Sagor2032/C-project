Assignment1: Generate a coin dispenser machine. This machine would dispense change for any appropriate monetary value.
This value should be less than $100. The machine uses an algorithm which dispenses the
least number of coins based on the US coin system of quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies.
The coin dispenser is also able to accept any number of coins and refund that amount to your credit card.
